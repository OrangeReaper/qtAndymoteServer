# Qt AndyMOTE Server
Qt Based Server for AndyMOTE App

Qt AndyMOTE Server is part of the AndyMOTE Project

The AndyMOTE Project's aim is to provide a 'Universal Remote Control' ie provide a single interface for
multiple infra-red remote controls and native interface to Kodi boxes

The AndyMOTE Server connects to an (Android) AndyMOTE App through a local network (See diagram).
